Problem:
Write a method that takes two arrays of integers of equal length
  For each respective member, take the square of the absolute value difference

Return the average of all the aforementioned differences

accepts two integer arrays of equal length
compares the value each member in one array to the corresponding member in the other
squares the absolute value difference between those two values
and returns the average of those squared absolute value difference between each member pair.

Examples:

  [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]              -->   9   because (9 + 9 + 9) / 3
[10, 20, 10, 2], [10, 25, 5, -2]  -->  16.5 because (0 + 25 + 25 + 16) / 4
[-1, 0], [0, -1]                  -->   1   because (1 + 1) / 2

Data Structures:
Input: Array of Ints, Array of Ints,
Return: Integer/Float (depending on the math)
Output: N/A

Algorithm:

Initialize a holder array to store the absolute differences
Initialize a counter object to 0

Loop
  Use the counter object as an index position to select the respective elements of each array
  Determine their absolute val difference
  Append this difference to the holder array
  Increment counter object
End Loop

Use reduce to sum the squares

Divide the sum by the input array length
